Pancreatic islet cells passage using the extroducer
===
## Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the possibility to passage the pancreatic islet cells and stem cell aggregates through the device
## Setting
**Location:** Huddinge University Hospital, Neo building, Lanner Laboratory  
**Involved** **people:** Jonathan Al-Saadi, Ulrik Birgersson, Eda Erbil (PhD student), Shivam Chandel (Post-Doc)  
**Date:** 2025-11-07  
**Time:** 12:30  

## Previous work
- Shivam and Eda previously tried injecting islets through the device (around 500) but found no islets on the other side. There was no clog. No data recorded or saved.  
- Jonathan have previously passaged HVPs and hMSCs through the device. Data from those experiments show that high flows speeds result in higher _proportion passaged_ while keeping *viability* high
