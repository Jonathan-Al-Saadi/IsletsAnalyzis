Pancreatic islet cells passage using the extroducer
===
## Objective
The objective of this study was to examine the possibility to passage the pancreatic islet cells and stem cell aggregates through the device
## Setting
**Location:** Huddinge University Hospital, Neo building, Lanner Laboratory  
**Involved** **people:** Jonathan Al-Saadi, Ulrik Birgersson, Eda Erbil (PhD student), Shivam Chandel (Post-Doc)  
**Date:** 2025-11-07  
**Time:** 12:30  

## Previous work
- Shivam and Eda previously tried injecting islets through the device (around 500) but found no islets on the other side. There was no clog. No data recorded or saved.  
- Jonathan have previously passaged HVPs and hMSCs through the device. Data from those experiments show that high flows speeds result in higher _proportion passaged_ while keeping *viability* high

 ## Background
Pancreatic islets are either natural allogen or grown islets that contain a heterogenus group of cells. 

| Cells   | Produce |
| ------- | ------- |
| β-cells | insulin |
| α-cells | glucagon |
| δ-cells        | somatostatin        |

### Why transplant pancreatic islets instead of single cell types?

Pancreatic islets function as a coordinated micro-organ that regulates blood glucose. They contain β-cells (insulin), α-cells (glucagon), and δ-cells (somatostatin), allowing for built-in feedback control. This integrated signaling enables physiological insulin release when glucose is high and glucagon release when glucose is low, reducing the risk of hypoglycemia. In contrast, isolated β-cells or engineered insulin-producing cells lack this regulatory balance and often show less stable function. Therefore, islet transplantation provides more natural, reliable glucose regulation than individual cell transplants.

### Challenges with pancreatic islet transplantation from humans

- **Immune rejection and autoimmunity:** Transplanted islets are targeted by both alloimmune responses and the patient’s underlying type 1 diabetes autoimmunity, requiring lifelong immunosuppression.
- **Loss of islet mass after transplantation:** A large fraction of islets die shortly after infusion due to ischemia, inflammation, and instant blood-mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR).
- **Limited donor supply:** High-quality human donor pancreases are scarce, and many patients require islets from more than one donor to achieve insulin independence.
- **Suboptimal engraftment site:** The liver (portal vein) is the standard site but provides poor oxygenation and exposes islets to inflammatory and metabolic stress. It is also not representative of the real arterial blood glucose.

### Potential solution
Growing pancreatic islets will allow for selecting cells without specific markers decreasing the need for immunosuppression and increasing the chance of engraftments and the need for donors.  
Using the extroducer will allow for transplantation of these islets directly to the pancreas which will be more physiological and allow for better and real arterial blood glucose control.  


## Methods
### Islets
Pancreatic islets were cultured according to the protocol described by Lanner et al. A total of 35,000 islets were isolated and expanded, alongside 10,000 stem cell–derived aggregates. Islet size was controlled during culture, with a target diameter of approximately 100 µm. All cultures were maintained under standard humidified incubator conditions (37 °C, 5% CO₂) and routinely monitored for morphology and viability throughout the expansion period.
### Harvest
Islets where harvested by aspiration and then let to sedement in a falcon tube. The supernatant was removed by aspiration and the islets where resuspended in the final carrier solution. For these experiments the carrier solution where:  

- PBS
- PBS + Pyronics 1% and BSA 1% 

### Counting
Counting was performed by sedementing the islets to the middle of a dish and then taking a photo with a camera through a microscope then counting the amount. 

### Injections/Passages  
The islets where aspirated through a metal 21G needle (0.8x40mm) to a plastic syringe, the syringe that comes with the device. Before aspiration the cells were gently resuspended in the carrier solution by pipetting the volume up and down using the syringe. The islets where then passaged with high speeds to a 12 well plates and PBS was added to make counting easier. The islets where then flushed using the carrier solution and the same volumes. 

## Results  
### Islets  
The pancreatic islets that where grown (in total 35 000) had fused. This resulted in large islets that were larger than expected. Some where in the magnitude of 150 um.

*Example of how the islets fuse* 

Thus, we did not move forward with the pancreatic islets.

### Stem cell aggregates
The stem cell aggregates had a size of approx 115um. It was approximately 400 cells per aggregate. As previous experiments had started with 400 aggregates we did the same. 
The time of handling was long (Table 1). In total it took 23 minutes until the aggregates where pushed through the device in which they could have fused as well. 

> [!WARNING]
 > Increased time --> more fusion 

#### Timing of Aggregate Handling Procedure


| Step               | Time     | Time Elapsed from Start |
|--------------------|----------|-------------------------|
| Start pipetting    | 13:33:00 | 0:00:00                 |
| End pipetting      | 13:34:20 | 0:01:20                 |
| Move to new plate  | 13:36:00 | 0:03:00                 |
| Start counting     | 13:36:30 | 0:03:30                 |
| End counting       | 13:43:40 | 0:10:40                 |
| Wash start         | 13:45:00 | 0:12:00                 |
| Count rest         | 13:48:42 | 0:15:42                 |
| Aspirate           | 13:52:40 | 0:19:40                 |
| Push to well       | 13:56:50 | 0:23:50                 |


Aggregates where pushed through the syringe and calculated manually by taking a picture in the microscope with the phone. Of the 400 aggregates passed thorugh the device only 94 where passaged in the first run. The rest where found in the syringe. After resuspenion in PBS only 34 passaged. When resuspended and aggitated in the syringe 93 where passaged. Viability was high and only 2-5 dead where found in each run. 

We then increased the injection volume but had the same concentration (i.e injecting 1200 aggregates in 300 ul PBS). We then saw 586 aggregates with 10 dead in the first injection and after resuspension in 300 ul 54, and next flush 11 passed but with less viability. 

Lastly we tried using pyronics and BSA in the PBS to decrese the stress on the aggregates but this resulted in only 385 passaged out of 1200 injected.
